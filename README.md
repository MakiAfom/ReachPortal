Refugee Empowerment Initiative  This proposal aims to amplify the voices of refugees, who often face barriers in accessing aid and employment opportunities in their host countries. By providing the necessary resources, we can unleash the authentic potential within each refugee community. Our focus lies in tackling unemployment and nurturing entrepreneurship skills among refugees, as exemplified by the success stories of our fellow refugees.  We are committed to uniting with stakeholders to articulate our vision, mission, objectives, and a concise introduction about our initiative. 
Our vision 
•	address unemployment and showcase the entrepreneurial spirit within refugee communities. We aim to create a network of refugees from various countries, fostering collaboration and creating pathways for talent to flourish.
To this end,
•	we propose the establishment of an organization called "From Refugees to Entrepreneurs." 
The objective 
•	mitigate the myriad challenges faced by refugees in accessing employment due to various barriers in their host countries.
Our ultimate goal 
•	to align with stakeholders who share our vision and can support our initiative. By forging partnerships with like-minded individuals and organizations, we can amplify our impact and create meaningful change for refugees worldwide.
